# ðŸŒ¿ Plant-Disease-Detection

A deep learning project for predicting plant diseases using a custom CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras.
The model classifies 38 types of plant diseases using the PlantVillage dataset.
Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques were applied to boost model performance.
Includes steps from loading and processing data to training and evaluating the model.

The PlantVillage dataset, originally published by Hughes & SalathÃ© (2015), is a benchmark dataset for plant disease classification. It includes high-quality, expert-labeled images of both healthy and diseased plant leaves.

ðŸ“Š Key Dataset Details
- Total Images: ~54,000 to 61,000 â€” depending on the version
  
- Classes: 38 distinct categories of plant species and disease combinations 

- Crop Types: Apple, Corn, Grape, Potato, Tomato, and more
  

This Porject demonstrates an end-to-end project for classifying plant diseases from leaf images.

- Objective: To build a deep learning model that can accurately identify 38 different types of plant diseases.

- Dataset: The public PlantVillage dataset.

- Approach: A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras. Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve model robustness.

- Workflow: The process includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation.
